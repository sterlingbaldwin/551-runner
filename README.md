# Assignment 1

* This assumnes the applications are named serial and parallel as specified in the [write up](http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~judyc/1516S-csci551/assignments/02-integration.html)
* This assumes that the serial program gives no output except an integer with the number of traps
* The integer is saved in config.json after running serial, if you would to manually set n for the parallel runs, just change the value in config
* I assume you have matplotlib installed
